This software package is the reference software for Deep Learning-Based Video Coding (DLVC). The reference software includes both encoder and decoder functionality.

Reference software is useful in aiding users of a video coding scheme to establish and test conformance and interoperability, and to educate users and demonstrate the capabilities of the scheme.

The software has been jointly developed by the University of Science and Technology of China, Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., Peking University, Harbin Institute of Technology, and Wuhan University. It is developed based on the JEM software, please refer to README_JEM for more details.

For quick usage, please refer to USAGE. A software manual, which contains usage instructions, can be found in the "doc" subdirectory of this software package.
